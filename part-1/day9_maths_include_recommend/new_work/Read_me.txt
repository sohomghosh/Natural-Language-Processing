Here i have analysed the mixed_review.txt file.
I have found no. of positive & negative words per title and represented them pictorially.
X-axis has valued like 0 0 , 0 1 , 0 2
0 0 basically means that the title has 0 positive words and 0 negative words


Y-axis represents the frequency of 0 0 , 0 1 i.e. no of instances they are occuring.

Findings & Prediction: no. of words with one postive word and one negative word is maximum. Thus we can conclude that most users write one positive word in the title of a  positive review. Thus, a user who has already written a postive word have high tendency that he will write a postive review and will use neutral words thereafter.
