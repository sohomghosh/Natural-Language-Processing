Problem with this Micromax GC222

I had purchaged this Mobile on 11 May 2013 online through flipkart only. Once I received and started using getting below issue:----

1. Battery is not reliable (only works 2 hrs. or less contin.. and in stand-by around 48 Hrs)
2. Sound quality is not good ( you have to get the voice with back of speaker)
3. While talking with MicroMax GC222 .. Mobile gets switch off automatically

The worst thing:- I had reported this issue with them but there were no response...
I recommended not to buy this product.... in same price you can find another option and you'll get that.
