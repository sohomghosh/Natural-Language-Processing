I ordered this product on 13th and received it on 16th morning. Very satisfactory service. The packing could have been better i agree, but the product was undamaged. Got a very good quality HP backpack as well.
Hardware is awesome. Finishing is professional. Not too heavy and ergonomically a great shape.
Coming to the OS, i purchased windows 8.1 and it is working like a breeze. Getting all the drivers was a little time taking but after installing everything, it just worked fabulously. Can't comment on the battery life as yet. But the HD screen, True vision webcam and processing speed is awesome. The dedicated graphics memory is only detected after installing the AMD catalyst driver. The keyboard is spring loaded i guess because it gives excellent feedback. Overall, An amazing product.
