Ode to a pig.;
Basically filmed performance art.

O'Horgans troupe put together a (barely) musical skit about a farmer unlucky in love.

Well, human love anyway.

So he falls for his pig. The devotion is almost touching.

Don't worry.....no bestiality here. This isn't one of THOSE underground films. None of that freaky stuff here.

Siskel and Ebert called this one of their turkeys of the week way back when. I found it in a video bin in New Jersey and watched it with a group of half drunk friends.

None of us knew what the hell was going on but we all stayed until the end.

Hypnotic....if you're in the right daring mood.
