Two buddies on a lark during The Great War;
Finally broadcast by Turner Classic Movies on December 15, 2004. The best feature of this comedy-drama is in fact the directing. Unusual overhead shots, clever arrangements of actors to later reveal a different situation than first seen, make this film stand out. Director Lewis Milestone would go on to do "All Quiet on the Western Front," "The Front Page," "Of Mice and Men," and the 1962 "Mutiny on the Bounty." The plot is a bit convoluted (war in the trenches to a prison camp, to the high seas, and finally in Arabia) and there is some problems with continuity, but a synopsis is that boy meets girl and boy gets girl. The writing appears to have been above average but are we looking at the original titles or was the text altered and updated during the restoration? William Boyd (AKA Hopalong Cassidy) is actually believable as a carefree World War I doughboy as is Louis Wolheim as his buddy the Sergeant. Michael Visaroff is excellent as the lecherous ship's captain. The film also features a twenty-one year old Mary Astor and Boris Karloff. New music provides a pleasant accompaniment. Film quality is not great, but it is apparently all that we can get.
