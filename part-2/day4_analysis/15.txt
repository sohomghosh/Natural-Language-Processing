One of three Oscar winning films unavailable for viewing.;
There are only three Oscar winning films that are unavailable for viewing. Two of them (THE PATRIOT -Best Screenplay; THE WAY OF ALL FLESH - Best Actor) are lost. The third is Lewis Milestone's directorial win the first year of the Oscars for TWO ARABIAN KNIGHTS. The film (along with a Best Picture nominee of the same year, THE RACKET, also directed by Milestone) does exist in both negative and 35 mm print form, housed at an "obscure location" and owned by the Howard Hughes Estate. Problems with rights keep both Lewis Milestone films from distribution. They have never been released to television or video and no archive contains material on them. It is to be hoped that these two important films are made available to the public in the near future.
