A very bad trip on the wild side;
What is this? A bunch of idiots, a field, a little stage and (too bad for us) a camera. A grand experiment all right, a grand experiment in lousiness. It goes on just like a very bad dream. It's totally unwatchable. I had to watch it in 3 or 4 segments so not to get carried away and throw the tape by the window. It's like watching a 10 hours movie about the life of a cereal or something like that. Just one question pops out: what where they thinking, or smoking when they made that one! And the music, it's so annoying.

Out of 100, I gave it 47. That's good for 0 star out of ****.
