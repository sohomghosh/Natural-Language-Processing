A Timeless Comedy;
Two Arabian Knights is a film about escape from a prisoner of war camp, but it is a comedy. The title of this silent film from 1927 is the first clue that it's a comedy.

This restored film has some spots where the images are grainy or damaged, but not enough to be annoying. And other parts of the film display really excellent image quality.

I found this film delightful. The two protagonists, who conspire and escape together, are not really friends. They rub each other the wrong way and they do not hide that fact. Still, they have a common goal and work together to escape. They tunnel, they disguise themselves, they hide. It seems like they will never achieve ultimate freedom, as something always goes wrong for them.

Along the way, they meet an Arab princess (Mary Astor) who provides some diversion from their objective.

I love the way the director framed this picture. He had a knack for zooming in close when the actors' faces are most important, and holding back when the action is most important, sometimes allowing the actors to be off-screen. The stunts are well-designed and satisfying, as if the director adhered to a strict policy of design quality. In a film from the 20s, this is a trait to be appreciated.

The humor in Two Arabian Knights is timeless, just as enjoyable today as when it was filmed.
