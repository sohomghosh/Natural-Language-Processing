huh?;
This impossibly overboard counterculture spectacle denotes a man's deep romantic feelings for a pig...a love so taboo that even his hillbilly kinfolk are arms-up in horror over it.

It's a musical of sorts, sourced from an Off-Off-Broadway stage piece which apparently generated some degree of enthusiasm in its time. FUTZ is also aggressively pushy with its strangely illustrated, cryptoglyphic sociopolitical commentary, touching mostly on issues of autonomy and sufferance. So, it is what it is...AN EXPERIMENTAL, METAPHORICAL, ZOOPHELIA HILLBILLY MUSICAL. While it's generally immersed in derisive absurdist humor, it alternately crosses some serious, even discomforting junctures along the way.

Sounds too exquisitely nonconformist to pass up, doesn't it?

Well...this raging avalanche of officiously arty grandeur might succeed as a fascinating rumination on creative onanism...it definitely has the requisite freak appeal for a very select entente of outsider types. Mainstreamers, however, won't surrender gently to this megalomaniacal, dope-fueled celluloid spitball.
