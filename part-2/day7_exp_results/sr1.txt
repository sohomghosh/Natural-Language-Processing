The Shawshank Redemption

Tied for the best movie I have ever seen

Suggestions: "really, new, low, hard, more, far, believable, Sure, potential, already, interesting, here, solid, socially, critic, ""cool"", special, average, much, exposed, meet, always, time, good, unspecified, future, where, quickly, single, high, wages, there's, better, more, instead, conventional, high, most, purely, free, creative, vehicular,potential, comfortably, highly,"

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.
